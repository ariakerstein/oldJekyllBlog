It&#8217;s been a great trip to Boston thus far. I miss the summer textures of New England.

**Some highlights include:**

  * Pool party in Arlington with the boys
  * Running down Memorial drive at midnight &#8211; balmy evenings are wonderful for running!
  * Trip to RI to see Grandma
  * Date night at Kendall sq.
