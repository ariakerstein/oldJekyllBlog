This was a final project for a data modeling course using SAS.

The purpose of this project was to examine the major factors affecting the cost of flying a passenger per
  
mile (CPM). We examined 6 different independent variables and 24 derived variables and finally settled
  
on 3 different OLS models based on length of flight and the size of the aircraft.
  
We found that the most important factors in the data are the load factor and the number of seats per air
  
craft in various interactions with themselves and other variables.

Attached is a summary of our study.
