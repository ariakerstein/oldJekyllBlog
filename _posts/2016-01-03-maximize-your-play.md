When I consider what a successful life looks like, I should think in the end that being able to honestly say something like this is what matters.

> I don’t know what I may seem to the world,” he (Newton) said before he died, “but, as to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

-Sir Isaac Newton
