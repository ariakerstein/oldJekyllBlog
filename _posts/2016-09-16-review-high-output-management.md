This is probably the best management book I&#8217;ve read. It&#8217;s straightforward, deep, and supports multiple readings. Summary notes from High Output Management (Intel&#8217;s CEO, Andy Grove, RIP):

>   * _The most common problem cited (by 20 middle managers) was uncontrolled interruptions, which in remarkable uniform fashion affected both supervisory and know-how managers. Everyone felt that the interruptions got in the way of his &#8220;own&#8221; work. Interruptions had a common source, most frequently coming from subordinates and from people outside the managers&#8217; immediate organization but whose work the managers influenced. _
>   * To gain better control of his time, the manager should use his calendar as a &#8220;production&#8221; plaanning tool, taking a firm initiative to schedule work that is not time-critical between meetings&#8230;move toward the active use of your calendar, filling holes between meetings&#8230;.say no at the outset to protect your time.
>   * The real sign of malogranization is when people spend more than 25% of their time in ad hoc mission-oriented meetings.
>   * Six questions for a decision: 
>       * what decision needs to be made?
>       * when does it have to be made?
>       * who will decide?
>       * who will need to be consulted prior to making the decision?
>       * who will ratify or veto the decision?
>       * who will need to be informed of the decision?
>   * As a manager you should remind yourself that each time an insight or fact is withheld and an appropriate question is suppressed, the decision-making process is less good than it might have been.
>   * So ,instead of going into hiding, a manager can hang a sign on his door that says, &#8220;I am doing individual work. Please don&#8217;t interrupt me unless it really can&#8217;t wait until 2:00&#8221;.
>   * A meeting is nothing less than the medium through which managerial work is performed&#8230;before calling a meeting ask yourself: 
>       * what am I trying to accomplish?
>       * is a meeting necessary? Or desirable? Or justifiable?
>       * If not all answers are YES then don&#8217;t call the meeting!
>   * There are two types of meeting: 
>       * **process-oriented:** knowledge is shared, information is exchanged. 
>           * 1:1 
>               * the 1:1 should be regarded as the subordinate&#8217;s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him. There&#8217;s good reason&#8230;.someone needs to prepare for the meeting&#8230;the supervisor with eight subordinates would have to prepare 8 times, the subordinate once.
>           * staff meeting 
>               * interaction among peers
>               * supervisor learns about issues by listening to debate among SME
>           * operation review 
>               * learning and exchange among different personnel across teams and levels
>       * **mission-oriented:** solve a specific problem.
