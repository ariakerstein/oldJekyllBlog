I never watch the today show, but today I did&#8230;

Stephanie Oakes plugged the Akrowheels as a great Christmas gift, which it is,

but NBC plugged it as $200 &#8211; still a great value in my opinion, but Stephanie was on top of it, citing the correct number $79.95.

(note: commercial at beginnning is only a few seconds)
