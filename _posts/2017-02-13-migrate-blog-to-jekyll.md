I've been using wordpress for over a decade in many forms. But now it's time to move to Jekyll. I'm doing this for greater control over the full stack - no more php dbs etc. Inspired by [Goran Kropp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ran_Kropp), which is to say adventure seeking that is self sufficient and for it's own sake. The joy of writing is in the creation and flow state. I find that writing and coding merge beautifully to produce a higher level of being and existence. When I was in college I remember vividly being in math classes and having my ideaphoria firing on all cylinders. Going through notebooks in my garage I noticed the right hand of the pages would be equations and on the left, in the margins would be crazy product ideas, philosophical mentations, left-field questions, pictures. So fun. The other reason is that in WP I would tend to write directly from the CMS UI. Ugh. So here's to a new chapter in my writing workflow.
