The day begins at 4:30. I must have eaten more than I can remember the previous night. I cooked up a vat of pasta, garlic bread and salad for a few folks including some fellow K-star runners. We watch chariots of fire on the 40&#8243; screen while shoveling the food down.

Out the door I get some green tea and honey at the local Starbucks (a staple for my marathons). On the bus ride over the course I feel disconcertingly unexcited. In fact I&#8217;ve had trouble &#8216;getting up&#8217; for this race for the past several days. Last year I couldn&#8217;t sleep the day before the BM. This year I slept too well. I feel little besides un-anticipation and dullness. I even felt some apprehension &#8211; not nervousness &#8211; that my training was crap and that I was totally unprepared.

Anyway, I try to shut off the stream of thoughts and turn on the autopilot.
  
On the busride over I listen to music: michael jackson &#8216;beat it&#8217;, some coldplay, ben folds five,Â  vivaldi, peter gabriel&#8230;
  
I&#8217;m with Abe &#8211; we decided to run together in attempts to break 3:00 for the 2nd time together. Abe had the GPS to keep us honest on the steep downhills that characterize the first 16 miles. We wait for the signal. Two F-14 fighter jets pass overhead in formation. Despite my distaste for military spending I was awed by the simple utilitarian beauty of these machines. The air is cool, perfect for a race. We shuffle to the start and cross the rubber line &#8211; we sound like barcodes at the market. For a moment there is an eerie stillness; total silence but for 25000 running shoes on concrete.

The first miles are easy. I still feel apprehension and what I know is an unhealthy respect for the miles ahead &#8211; unhealthy in that apprehension is not the friend of an athlete. I try to conserve my energy and use gravity to carry me forward. I know that the race doesn&#8217;t begin for me until Newton so I try to settle into some kind of rhythm and knock out the first half of the race.
  
Up to mile 10 I can&#8217;t say anything remarkable happened. I felt strong and was continuously held in check by Abe. In looking over the numbers from last year it is true that I ran too fast in the first half. Therefore I was trying to remain slower at the start than last year, though I hoped to beat my time.Â  Around mile 10 I actually was not feeling all that great. I decided that audacity is a virtue and that I really didn&#8217;t want to feel this dullness that was still in my legs and my mind. F- Newton, I thought, Bring it on. Over the next 6 miles all I remember is Abe keeping me from pulling ahead too much for which I am very thankful; it was like my old piano teacher, Bela, with the metronome.

The hills were pretty easy. I had decided to start attacking instead of sitting back. I remember turning to abe and saying something like &#8216;Where&#8217;s Newton, this thing?&#8217;.
  
And my legs started giving me trouble similar to my grammar in the last sentence. The up and down had taken its toll.
  
So I curse myself for not training harder, my legs are rubbery&#8230;

Abe starts to pull ahead.
  
I catch up.
  
Abe pulls ahead,
  
I catch up
  
_Shit_
  
I put on a small burst, pull ahead&#8230;
  
Abe catches
  
_F-ing bitch!
  
_ I go

By mile 22 I was holding on for life. The thing I remember above all was that I wanted to hang back as Abe was pulling ahead. I cursed myself, got angry and decided I&#8217;d rather collapse.
  
I focus on my arms as it distracts me from my legs. Light posts become my friend and I realize the wisdom of breaking up challenges into small parts. Whereas each mile to this point was taken on a mile basis I now took it by light post increments of several hundred yards &#8211; fartlek style. Off in the distance I see the Citgo sign &#8211; frighteningly distant. My quads ceased to work in my favor, instead they felt like brakes. I stopped keeping track of my times and just kept working.

So I missed by sub 3 goal, ending in 3:01:27.
  
I was satisfied in that I could have easily finished a few minutes slower but dug deep and pushed when I really didn&#8217;t feel like I had anything left.
