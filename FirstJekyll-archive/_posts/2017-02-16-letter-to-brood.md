You kids complete me. You're too young to know what it means to be laid off but that's what happened a few weeks ago. You haven't thought to ask why I've been doing more pickup and dropoff recently? Or why I've been in a WAY better mood. Or spending more quality time with you. And I'm glad because being laid off stung for about a day and then I moved past it. I consider this the best gift I've received in a long time. Why? Because I feel strongly that this provided me an opportunity to re-pattern my mindset and orient towards you, towards genuine happiness. I was clearly biasing towards financial rewards. Perhaps that's what I needed to do to get us into a good position. I tell myself this and do think there's some truth in it. But I'll never do it again. You are too important to me. And my own lifeforce is too precious to trade for some coin.

Lua - you work up this morning smiling at me and mom. We can't wait to see who you are!
Saul - you have been so sweet lately. You want to squeeze and hold 'sister' every minute she's around. Your desire to connect and nurture her is obvious and is so inspiring. You are clearly a leader. And you have this tender side too. This is a beautiful combination and you inspire me every day.
Lev - I walked you home from school yesterday. The delight on your face getting onto the J-Church muni made me want to weep tears of joy. To see such delight in your face is to me the definition of purity. All my worries go away when I see your eyes light up like that. Please never lose this.

So I think what does it mean to be a father to you and what will I give you apart from things? What will be the lessons you take with you in your days that I can impart NOW while it actually matters? My current thinking is that providing you a rich environment conducive to inquiry, exploration and freedom of expression is important. I believe that generating quality memories and experiences matters. A lot. Imparting a love of nature and science and undersatnding how things work is important. But it's more important to foster a mindset that cares to ask the question in the first place, curiosity. And of course empathy. We should care for our fellow world citizens. We should create new things with the abundance we've inherited to 'make it better'. We have a duty to make the world better. Jews call this 'tikkun Olam'. We should create genuine and lasting friendships with people that we can help and that can help us. THe point of it is to create experiences and memories that we will carry with us through our days. Struggle and hard work are other values to internalize. But the key part of struggle is to ensure it's in the right direction. The Buddha calls this 'right effort'. Let's ensure that our efforts are pointed int eh direction of the good. I've kept that vague because good is becoming increasingly complicated to define. It is not always true that good intentions lead to favorable outcomes. This is important to undersatnd and is why study and crisp thinking matters. Good intentions matter but aren't the full story. We'll talk more about this. 
To summarize the family values:
